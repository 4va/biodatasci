## Important libraries to load

If you don't have a particular CRAN package installed already: `install.packages(tidyverse)`. The **tidyverse**, **survival**, and **survminer** packages are required for this lesson. For looking at TCGA data, you'll also need **RTCGA**, **RTCGA.clinical**, and **RTCGA.mRNA** from Bioconductor. See the course website for setup instructions for Bioconductor packages.

```r
# CRAN Packages needed
library(tidyverse)   # loads dplyr, ggplot2, readr, etc.
library(survival)    # core survival analysis functions
library(survminer)   # recommended for visualizing survival curves

# Bioconductor packages
library(RTCGA)
library(RTCGA.clinical)
library(RTCGA.mRNA)
```

## The pipe: **`%>%`**

When you load the **dplyr** or **tidyverse* library you can use **`%>%`**, the _pipe_. Running **`x %>% f(args)`** is the same as **`f(x, args)`**. If you wanted to run function `f()` on data `x`, then run function `g()` on that, then run function `h()` on that result: instead of nesting multiple functions, **`h(g(f(x)))`**, it's preferable and more readable to create a chain or pipeline of functions: **`x %>% f %>% g %>% h`**. Pipelines can be spread across multiple lines, with each line ending in `%>%` until the pipeline terminates. The keyboard shortcut for inserting `%>%` is Cmd+Shift+M on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows.

## Functions

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(read.csv("r-survival-cheatsheet.csv", check.names=FALSE))
```
