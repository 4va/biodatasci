These workshops introduce methods, tools, and software for reproducibly managing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale biomedical data using the R statistical computing environment.

**_IMPORTANT_: [Click here for instructions on setting up your computer for any of these workshops](setup-r.html).** Each workshop involves lots of hands-on practice coding, and you'll need to download and install some free software **_prior to our first class_**. This may take up to an hour or so, and please do not hesitate to [email me](people.html) _prior to the workshop_ if you are having difficulty.
